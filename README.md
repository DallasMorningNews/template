awesome interactives template
========

The home of the updated interactive page template.

The template folder is updated and maintained using git in a repository hosted on github.

Clone the github repository into a local directory using your console. First `cd` into the directory you want to put the template and then execute this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/template.git
```

Git is version control software. It saves all the changes you make to your code in a way that makes it easy to rollback any mistakes and to share it and collaborate with others.

Github is a web service used to host your code online and make it readily available to others.

Every repository comes with a git cheatsheet, but *if this is your first time* using git, make a beeline for this super easy 15-minute interactive tutorial:

In most cases, once you've cloned this repository, the most you'll ever have to touch git is to "commit"/save new changes to the template and "push"/publish them to github.

So that means we can boil down a simple set of commands.

1. Always get the latest version of files before you begin

    `git pull` 

2. Do work!

3. Add any new files you made to the tracker 
    
     `git add * `

4. Save any changes to existing files

    `git commit -am "{some text explaining what's new}" `

5. Publish your changes for everyone to use

    `git push`


Since this template isn't updated too often and is rarely worked on by more than one person at once, you generally won't need to worry about git concepts like branching, which allow you to work on different pieces of code simultaneously and independent of other designers and then safely "merge" everyone's changes together.

##Best practices
Keep this template code in a dedicated directory on your computer. `git pull` any changes and then copy and paste the template folder into a specific project folder for each interactive you work on.
