Directions for use:

1. Download the template directory to your local machine, then move it into the "interactives" directory on your hard drive, replacing any old template directory if needed.

2. Duplicate the "starterkit" directory within "templates"

3. Rename your duplicated "starterkit" directory and move it to the "interactives" directory on your hard drive

4. Build your interactive within your renamed "starterkit" direcotry. You may use the code-blocks for pre-styled html elements, or write your own html/css/js. 

The template folder is updated and maintained using git in a repository hosted on github.
